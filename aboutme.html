        <p>Hello! my name is Benji. I am 17 years old, and a former baby. My hobbies are playing badminton because I like the shuttlecock, 
            as well as playing guitar because I like music. I am 6 feet, 11 inches. That might seem wrong, but they are just two separate measurements.
            I like reading literature, and learning about other cultures through conversation and fun! I hope one day I can meet all people of all cultures so
            I can have a better understanding of the world and the different people in it.
