        <p>Kant says, transcendental
                idealism. In Aquinas,
            
            we exist apart from bodies
                but only on Thursdays
            
            when his famous ox
                flies by the window
            
            wiser at Cologne
                where Albertus Magnus,
            
            his real name, appoints
                Aquinas to magister studentium,
            
            master of students. Aquinas
                is petrified but says yes.
            
            He feels his soul
                sailing out of his head
            
            floating near the roof
                where a blue ox wings by.
            
            On Wednesday, two bodies
                are one soul
            
            waking at sunrise
                thanks to the pineal gland
            
            of Descartes, who thinks
                this node in the brain
            
            is a tiny sugar cone
                or salted peanut,
            
            the seat of the soul
                while Aristotle points
            
            to the chopping
                ax as a teleology
            
            as if the ax were a living,
                breathing person
            
            which it isn’t.
                Heraclitus, air and fire
            
            while Aquinas objects, no
                not an ax but ox.
            
            If you’re a bird or soul
                I am only one mile
            
            from the sea. If you
                are a soul in two bodies
            
            life is more complex
                and we must labor
            
            twice the field of sorrow
                after sleep, bath, and a glass
            
            as Aquinas whispers, the things
                we love tell us who we are.
