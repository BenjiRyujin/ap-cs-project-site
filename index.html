        <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?user=benjics&project=U2L2-Mandala">Mandala Drawing App</a></p>
        <p>This drawing app allows you to create your own mandalas through a simple question asking how many lines and how big? I created this in late September, and am very proud of this creation. Enjoy!</p>

            <h2>Space Trace<h2>
                <p>This was a drawing app made by my buddy Kailan and me! We had to create a drawing app directed towards teaching children! We used Snap! by UC Berkeley and their curriculum to help build our tools!
                    When you load into the game, you are presented with a menu where you can draw set polygons, draw your own polygons, draw anything, erase, and go to CONSTELLATIONS. This leads you to a menu where you can trace 
                    any zodiac constellation in order to learn it! I learned how to code certain drawing tools and learned what each of the zodiac signs meant and looked like! The challenge of creating this app came from the 
                    burden of having to create every single sprite for each constellation, since we couldn't find pictures online of the zodiac constellations. This was very time consuming, but in the end rewarding!
